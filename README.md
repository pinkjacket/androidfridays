# _SwordsList_

#### _A program to list cool swords and take notes, 2/23/2018_

#### By _**James Donlan**_

## Description

_Finally, a list of cool swords right on your phone! This app comes with a list of 15 swords from various games and movies, plus a fact about each one. Additionally, you can enter some text on the main screen and save it as a note! You can currently only have one note at a time though, so make it a good one._

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* _Import project into Android Studio, preferably using the program itself_
* _Select "app" in the dropdown menu on the top right next to the green arrow, then click the arrow_
* _Set up an emulated Android phone to run it on. I recommend a Nexus 6 running Marshmallow or above, but anything above Ice Cream Sandwich should be all right_
* _Enjoy the swords!_

## Proposed Future Functionality

* _Run off some sort of sword-related API instead of a hard-coded list_
* _Improve list, maybe with pictures or more data_
* _Better notes_

## Technologies Used

* _Java_
*_Android_
